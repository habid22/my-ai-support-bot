# AI Customer Support Bot ðŸ¤–

This project is an AI-powered customer support bot for a car dealership, built using Next.js, Material-UI, and OpenAI (or other AI model services like Hugging Face). The bot can assist customers by providing information about various car models, answering common questions, and managing chat sessions.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can interact with the bot through a modern, sleek UI that mimics the look of popular messaging apps.
- **Session Management**: Users can start a new session or end the current one, with clear notifications displayed within the chat box.
- **Dynamic Responses**: The bot uses AI to provide contextually relevant responses to customer inquiries.
- **Custom Bot Avatar**: The bot displays a custom avatar for its messages, enhancing the visual experience.
